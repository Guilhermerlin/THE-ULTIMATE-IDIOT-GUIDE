    <p><em>Web development and IT student, <strong>future data scientist professional</strong></em>.</p>
    <p>This is kinda of a notebook that I'll be updating with the stuff I've studied and find usefull, fella. Feel free to use this shit if it helps you.
        I also like crafted beers and tobbaco by the way. Send me a present. :)</p>

    <h3>BASIC DO BASIC, RAPAZIADA</h3>
      <p><em>First you'll have to know what kind of tools you'll be using to build whatever the useless shit you want to (like this website). Check it below</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML
          <ul>
            <li>Used to make the <em>struture of the website</em>, it can be compared to a construction worker building the fundation of a house. You add buttons, links,
            everything that a human can interact with.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>CSS
          <ul>
            <li>This tool is used to <em>make everything look tidy, cosy and beautiful</em>. It can be compared to you hiding all the mess of the crack house you call bedroom,
             when some chick are invited to watch netflix.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>JS
          <ul>
            <li>Last but not least, this tool is used to make things acutally works. Remember the buttons you added with HTML? You're right, with Js you can add life to
            useless buttons like you, but you still a useless bitch, not the button anymore.</li>
          </ul>
